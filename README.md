# The DPDK GitHub Action
## Description
A small GitHub [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) used for various workflows I will be creating in my projects. This action deploys a standard configuration of [the DPDK](https://dpdk.org). It installs tools Python3, Pip3, Meson, and Ninja Build to install the DPDK. It's great/useful to use inside of GitHub workflows that require the DPDK to build.
